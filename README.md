## Introduction

Based on Marc Pony's matrix_calculate

Use C to write neural networks (now fully connected networks are realized)

## TODOLIST
```
matrix.c				(function) matrix_sort, unfulfilled
						(function) matrix_cut, row and column cut
                        (function) read_matrix_from_csv, Open file only once
                      	judge overwrite the original data, function matrix_average_broadcast overwrite the original data
                      	Multiple matrix calculations
                     	large matrix not create from heap
                     	
activation.c           	other activation function

init_weights.c			other init_weights function

network.c				use base layer struct
                        save and load weights
                        add comments
                        simplified matrix calculation
                        add rnn, cnn
```
